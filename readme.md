Spring Boot GraphQL Project
This is a Spring Boot application that demonstrates the usage of GraphQL for building a robust and flexible API.

Project Overview
The project is a Spring Boot application that utilizes the GraphQL framework to provide a powerful and efficient API for interacting with the application's data. The application is built using the following technologies:
Spring Boot: The popular Java web framework that provides a fast and efficient way to build and deploy web applications.
GraphQL: A query language for APIs that provides a more flexible and efficient alternative to traditional REST APIs.
Spring Data JPA: The Spring framework's data access layer that simplifies the implementation of data repositories.
H2 Database: An in-memory database used for development and testing purposes.

The application exposes a GraphQL API that allows clients to query and mutate data related to a specific domain, such as users, products, or orders. The API provides a schema that defines the available queries and mutations, as well as the data types and relationships between them.

Key Features
GraphQL API: The application provides a GraphQL API that allows clients to query and mutate data using a flexible and efficient query language.
Data Modeling: The application uses Spring Data JPA to define the data models and relationships between them, providing a robust and scalable data layer.
Query Optimization: The GraphQL API optimizes the data retrieval process by allowing clients to request only the data they need, reducing the amount of data transferred and improving overall performance.
Error Handling: The application implements robust error handling mechanisms to provide clear and informative error messages to clients in case of any issues.
Documentation: The project includes comprehensive documentation that explains the usage of the GraphQL API, including examples of queries and mutations, and the available data types and relationships.
