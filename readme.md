<h1>Spring Boot GraphQL Project</h1> <p>This is a Spring Boot application that demonstrates the usage of GraphQL for building a robust and flexible API.</p>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
The project is a Spring Boot application that utilizes the GraphQL framework to provide a powerful and efficient API for interacting with the application's data. The application is built using the following technologies:
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ui>
  <li>Spring Boot: The popular Java web framework that provides a fast and efficient way to build and deploy web applications.</li>
  <li>GraphQL: A query language for APIs that provides a more flexible and efficient alternative to traditional REST APIs.</li>
  <li>Spring Data JPA: The Spring framework's data access layer that simplifies the implementation of data repositories.</li>
  <li>H2 Database: An in-memory database used for development and testing purposes.</li> 
</ui>
The application exposes a GraphQL API that allows clients to query and mutate data related to a specific domain, such as users, products, or orders. The API provides a schema that defines the available queries and mutations, as well as the data types and relationships between them.
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ui>
  <li>GraphQL API: The application provides a GraphQL API that allows clients to query and mutate data using a flexible and efficient query language.</li>
  <li>Data Modeling: The application uses Spring Data JPA to define the data models and relationships between them, providing a robust and scalable data layer.</li>
  <li>Query Optimization: The GraphQL API optimizes the data retrieval process by allowing clients to request only the data they need, reducing the amount of data transferred and improving overall performance.</li>
  <li>Error Handling: The application implements robust error handling mechanisms to provide clear and informative error messages to clients in case of any issues.</li>
  <li>Documentation: The project includes comprehensive documentation that explains the usage of the GraphQL API, including examples of queries and mutations, and the available data types and relationships.</li>
</ui>
